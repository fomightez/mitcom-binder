    "Those paying attention may notice there is only 19 gene names listed there.  \n",
    "Consistent with one-off errors being [one of the hard things in computer science](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096?lang=en), despite what is stated in the manuscript, it seems there's only 19 in the lists produced from the correlation window. (I've tried it many times and it is always 19 in the correlation window itself. It's not the script missing one.) Even the reviewers didn't catch it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this script isn't limited to the list seen when in the 'Correlation' tab. You can use it on the table in the main 'Protein List' area, too, if for some reason you wanted. Or even just a segment withing that table. However, that table is available as Sheet 1 in the Excel spreadsheet file available as [Supplementary Table 1 (41586_2022_5641_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx)](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-022-05641-w/MediaObjects/41586_2022_5641_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx) among the 'Supplementary information' available with [Schulte et al 2023 'Mitochondrial complexome reveals quality-control pathways of protein import'](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05641-w#Sec29). I could imagine if you had several selected and wanted to record it and then get the names out later, it would be useful from the portal."
